# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
The general goal of this project is to collaborate with classmates on github and apply all the skills that have been aquired throughout the course till now including:
    * data collection (from APIs or other methods)
    * data cleaning
    * EDA
    * Regression Modelling
    * Creating Visualizations

For our project specifically, we will be exploring the topic of COVID-19 - more specifically, we will be trying to answer the following questions:
    1) How does the GDP per capita affect rates of infection (confirmed cases) and rates of mortality?
    2) How does location (longitude and neighbouring countries) affect the rates of infection and mortality?
    3) What kinds of insights can be made to predict future pandemics, their spread and outcomes?

## Process
### Step 1: Data Collection
Exploring what kinds of data is available for free
### Step 2: EDA
Initial exploration efforts to understand data and cleaning data as needed
### Step 3: Insights and Regression Modelling
In narrowing down the questions, various models are tried and iterated to get a reliable regression model
### Step 4: Create Visualizations
Once conclusions were reached, visualizations were created for presentation

## Results
Option 2 - FAA Wildlife Strikes, 2015

Questions:
1) What are the financial ramifications of wildlife strikes on the aviation industry?
2) What are the environmental ramifications of wildlife strikes on local ecosystems?



## Challenges 
One major challenge was the introduction of collboration on GitHub. This was the first time that any of us had any significant usage of Git and GitHub aside from the other projects (but did not require much Git usage). The process of data professions working together on one project similar to that of a workplace was able to teach us the importance of communication in:
    * direct messaging updates
    * comments on new commits
    * comments on code 
    * general organization (within GitHub, scheduling, and presenting)

Another challenge we faced was gathering data. In an effort to challenge ourselves, we wanted to query APIs to gather our data. Our oversight of the fact that the COVID-19 pandemic was official declared over in most countries by May of 2023, all API providers had since ended their regular updates. As a result, we were unable to query and APIs and had to rely on historical data. Fortunately, this data was very robust and useful for the rest of the project.
